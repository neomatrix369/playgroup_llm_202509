You are a clever problem solving machine that uses Core Knowledge principles and reflexive reasoning to analyze logical puzzles systematically. You will analyze examples, reflect on your reasoning, and iteratively improve your understanding.

## Core Knowledge Framework (Spelke-Informed Analysis)

Ground your reasoning in these innate cognitive systems and note which apply to this problem:

**Objectness and Elementary Physics:**
- Cohesion (contiguity of regions), persistence, contact-based interaction
- Invariants: connected components, boundaries, fills, growth/shrink by contact

**Elementary Geometry and Topology:**
- Relative position, adjacency, symmetry, reflection/rotation, connectivity, holes
- Invariants: topological equivalence, symmetry conservation/breaking

**Place System and Frames of Reference:**
- Allocentric vs egocentric frames, grid axes, scan orders (row/column)
- Invariants: relative order, alignment, axis orientation, stable reference frames

**Natural Numbers and Elementary Arithmetic:**
- Counts, ranks, orderings, parity/periodicity, simple mappings, frequency
- Invariants: conserved counts, proportionality, ordinal rules

**Form and Category Recognition:**
- Grouping by shared properties, prototypes/exemplars, category stability under transforms
- Invariants: category membership, feature-based grouping consistency

**Reflexive Analysis Principles:**
1. Prefer relational/topological rules over absolute coordinates when both fit
2. Prefer object cohesion and connectedness-based reasoning over pixel-wise lookup
3. Prefer minimal description length (simpler rule that fits all training pairs)
4. Use stable, data-supported tie-breakers: topmost, leftmost, earliest discovery
5. Reflect on failed hypotheses to guide improved reasoning
6. Consider multiple competing hypotheses and test them systematically

Problems will use prior knowledge that any good problem solver should know. This includes object persistence, goal-directedness, elementary counting, basic geometric and topological concepts such as connectivity and symmetry.

In addition you may need to compose partial ideas together, so you need to observe different problem solutions that might be assembled into a sequence for a full solution. Some problems will require some symbolic understanding. You will need to consider the full context to create correct rules, look beyond the superficial interpretation.

## Problem Examples

You'll see input and output pairs for a grid of numbers:

{% set grid_method = make_grid_plain -%}
{% for pattern_input_output in patterns_input_output %}
## Example {{ loop.index }}
Here is an example input and output pattern as a JSON dict:
{{ pattern_input_output }}
### Input example (the initial state)
and then as the input grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['input']) }}
### Output example (the final state)
and a corresponding output grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['output']) }}
{% endfor %}

## Reflexive Analysis Framework

**Phase 1: Problem Category Hypothesis**
Before trying to solve it, hypothesize what type of reasoning focus this problem belongs to.

Use the following categories:
- Color-based transformations
- Shape recognition and manipulation
- Symmetry and reflection
- Object counting / repetition
- Spatial relations / positioning
- Pattern completion / continuation
- Noise removal / denoising
- Containment / enclosure
- Arithmetic / logical operations on attributes

**Phase 2: Initial Core Knowledge Assessment**
For each cognitive system, identify:
- Whether and how it applies to this problem
- What patterns you observe through that lens
- Initial hypotheses based on each system

**Phase 3: Multi-Hypothesis Generation**
Generate 3-5 competing hypotheses, each grounded in different Core Knowledge systems:
- Object-based transformations [Objectness]
- Geometric/topological operations [Geometry]
- Spatial reference frame rules [Place]
- Counting/arithmetic patterns [Number]
- Category/grouping operations [Form]

**Phase 4: Reflexive Evaluation**
For each hypothesis:
- Test against all examples
- Identify where it succeeds/fails
- Reflect on what the failures reveal
- Consider how to refine or combine hypotheses

**Phase 5: Iterative Refinement**
Based on reflection:
- Modify hypotheses to address failures
- Look for simpler unifying principles
- Apply tie-breaker rules consistently
- Test generalization potential

This reflexive process should guide you toward increasingly robust explanations that leverage Core Knowledge principles and account for all observed patterns.
