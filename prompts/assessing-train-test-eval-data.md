## Current Landscape & Intelligence Gap

### The Challenge
The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) represents the current frontier in measuring fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning capabilities. The performance gap reveals critical limitations:

- **Human Performance**: 85% on original dataset, drops to 66% on enhanced ARC-AGI-2
- **Best AI Systems**: 31-50% accuracy (traditional approaches)
- **Recent Breakthroughs**: OpenAI's o3 achieving 76-88% accuracy through hybrid approaches

### Intelligence Measurement Framework
Intelligence is formalized as skill-acquisition efficiency under uncertainty:
```
I = Avg[GD / (P + E)]
```
Where:
- **GD**: Generalization difficulty that must be overcome
- **P**: Prior knowledge available 
- **E**: Experience provided
- **Goal**: Minimize P + E while maximizing successful generalization

## Mathematical Foundations

### Information-Theoretic Intelligence Measurement

**Algorithmic Information Theory**: Intelligence emerges from compression efficiency
- **Pattern Complexity**: Measured by compression ratios
- **Minimum Description Length**: Guides pattern selection
- **Relative Entropy Coding**: `KL(P||Q) = Σ P(x)log(P(x)/Q(x))`

**Shannon Entropy**: Quantifies pattern complexity through color distribution
```
H(C) = -Σ p(c)log₂p(c)
```

**Mutual Information**: Measures transformation content
```
I(Input; Output) = H(Input) - H(Input|Output)
```

### Topological and Geometric Principles

**Topological Connectivity**: Often preserved through transformations
```
π₀(X) ≅ π₀(T(X))
```
Connected components remain invariant through transformation T.

**Group Theory Applications**:
- Most transformations respect dihedral group D₄ symmetries
- Color transformations form symmetric groups Sₙ
- **Equivariant transformations**: `T(g·x) = g·T(x)`

**Graph Theory Representations**:
- Grids become planar graphs with colored vertices
- Path analysis enables line-drawing solutions
- Cycle detection identifies pattern completions
- Graph homomorphisms preserve structure during transformations

### Reasoning Type Classification Framework

Before attempting to solve any ARC-AGI task, perform a **reasoning type hypothesis** to guide your solving approach. This pre-analysis step helps focus attention on the most relevant transformation patterns and solving strategies.

#### Core Reasoning Categories

**Identify which category(ies) the task belongs to:**

1. **Color-based transformations**: Color mapping, substitution, conditional color changes
2. **Shape recognition and manipulation**: Object identification, geometric transformations, morphing
3. **Symmetry and reflection**: Mirror operations, rotational symmetry, axis-based transformations
4. **Object counting / repetition**: Quantitative analysis, duplication patterns, frequency-based rules
5. **Spatial relations / positioning**: Relative positioning, containment, adjacency, directional relationships
6. **Pattern completion / continuation**: Sequence extension, missing element inference, systematic progression
7. **Noise removal / denoising**: Filtering operations, outlier elimination, pattern purification
8. **Containment / enclosure**: Boundary analysis, inside/outside relationships, nested structures
9. **Arithmetic / logical operations on attributes**: Mathematical operations on object properties, conditional logic

#### Classification Process

For each task, output:
- **Which categories apply** (one or more - tasks often combine multiple reasoning types)
- **Short rationale** explaining why these categories are relevant
- **Primary vs. Secondary** categorization if multiple types apply

**Example Classification Template:**
```
Primary Category: [Most dominant reasoning type]
Secondary Categories: [Additional applicable types]
Rationale: [Brief explanation of why these categories apply]
Solving Focus: [How this classification guides your approach]
```

This classification directly informs which sections of the pattern taxonomy and solving strategies to prioritize during analysis.

**Integration Note**: All aspects of the suggested reasoning classification framework have been integrated as they complement and enhance the existing analytical approaches. 

**Spelke Framework Integration Note**: All elements of the Spelke-informed analysis have been successfully integrated as they provide crucial cognitive grounding that enhances the mathematical frameworks. The core knowledge systems provide the foundation for human-like abstract reasoning, while the tie-breaker policies offer practical guidance for hypothesis selection. No elements were ignored as they all strengthen the framework's cognitive validity and practical effectiveness.
