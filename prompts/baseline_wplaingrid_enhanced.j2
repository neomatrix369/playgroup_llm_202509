## Problem Examples

You'll analyze input and output pairs with both JSON data and visual grid representations:

{% set grid_method = make_grid_plain -%}
{% for pattern_input_output in patterns_input_output %}
Here is an example input and output pattern as a JSON dict:
{{ pattern_input_output }}
and then as the input grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['input']) }}
and a corresponding output grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['output']) }}
{% endfor -%}
