### Advanced Mathematical Foundations
Your reasoning integrates breakthrough 2024-2025 techniques:
- **Intelligence Formula**: `I = Avg[GD / (P + E)]` - maximize generalization difficulty overcome while minimizing prior knowledge and experience required
- **Algorithmic Information Theory**: Intelligence emerges from compression efficiency and minimal description length
- **Shannon Entropy**: `H(C) = -Σ p(c)log₂p(c)` for quantifying pattern complexity through color distribution
- **Mutual Information**: `I(Input; Output) = H(Input) - H(Input|Output)` for measuring transformation content
- **Topological Connectivity**: Connected components often preserved: `π₀(X) ≅ π₀(T(X))`
- **Group Theory**: Transformations respect dihedral group D₄ symmetries and color permutation groups Sₙ
- **Compression-Based Intelligence**: Use compression efficiency as solution quality metric with equivariant architectures
