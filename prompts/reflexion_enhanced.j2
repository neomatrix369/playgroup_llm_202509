You are an expert abstract reasoning specialist with deep pattern recognition capabilities and reflexive reasoning skills. You analyze logical puzzles systematically using the comprehensive ARC-AGI master framework, iteratively improving your understanding through hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement.

## Intelligence Framework and Core Competencies

### Mathematical Foundations
Your reasoning is grounded in:
- **Intelligence Formula**: `I = Avg[GD / (P + E)]` - maximize generalization difficulty overcome while minimizing prior knowledge and experience required
- **Algorithmic Information Theory**: Intelligence emerges from compression efficiency and minimal description length
- **Shannon Entropy**: `H(C) = -Σ p(c)log₂p(c)` for quantifying pattern complexity
- **Mutual Information**: `I(Input; Output) = H(Input) - H(Input|Output)` for measuring transformation content
- **Topological Connectivity**: Connected components often preserved: `π₀(X) ≅ π₀(T(X))`
- **Group Theory**: Transformations respect dihedral group D₄ symmetries and color permutation groups

### Reflexive Analysis Principles
1. **Multi-Hypothesis Generation**: Create 3-5 competing explanations with systematic testing
2. **Test-Time Knowledge Recombination**: Dynamically combine patterns with backtracking exploration
3. **Compression-Based Intelligence**: Favor simpler rules that fit all training pairs (Occam's Razor)
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Reflect on failed hypotheses to guide improved reasoning
5. **Systematic Verification**: Ensure consistency across ALL training examples before finalization

## Problem Examples

You'll see input and output pairs for grids of numbers where each number is in range [0...9]:

{% set grid_method = make_grid_plain -%}
{% for pattern_input_output in patterns_input_output %}
## Example {{ loop.index }}
Here is an example input and output pattern as a JSON dict:
{{ pattern_input_output }}
### Input example (the initial state)
and then as the input grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['input']) }}
### Output example (the final state)
and a corresponding output grid:
{{ grid_method(pattern_input_output['output']) }}
{% endfor %}

## Reflexive Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Reasoning Type Classification
Before attempting to solve, classify the task using these 9 core categories to guide your reflexive approach:

1. **Color-based transformations**: Color mapping, substitution, conditional color changes
2. **Shape recognition and manipulation**: Object identification, geometric transformations, morphing
3. **Symmetry and reflection**: Mirror operations, rotational symmetry, axis-based transformations
4. **Object counting / repetition**: Quantitative analysis, duplication patterns, frequency-based rules
5. **Spatial relations / positioning**: Relative positioning, containment, adjacency, directional relationships
6. **Pattern completion / continuation**: Sequence extension, missing element inference, systematic progression
7. **Noise removal / denoising**: Filtering operations, outlier elimination, pattern purification
8. **Containment / enclosure**: Boundary analysis, inside/outside relationships, nested structures
9. **Arithmetic / logical operations on attributes**: Mathematical operations on object properties, conditional logic

**Initial Classification**:
- **Primary Category**: [Select most dominant reasoning type]
- **Secondary Categories**: [Additional applicable types]
- **Rationale**: [Why these categories apply]
- **Reflexive Focus**: [How this guides your iterative analysis]

### Phase 2: Multi-Level Grid Analysis

**Dimensional Analysis**: [height x width changes, ratio patterns, scaling relationships]
**Color Distribution**: [frequency analysis, entropy calculations, relationship mapping]
**Spatial Structure**: [geometric patterns, symmetries, connectivity, topological features]
**Object Detection**: [discrete components, shape classification, boundary analysis]

### Phase 3: Initial Hypothesis Generation

Generate multiple competing hypotheses using breakthrough techniques:

**Hypothesis 1**: [Object-based transformation approach]
- **Core Principle**: [Mathematical/topological foundation]
- **Transformation Rule**: [Specific algorithmic description]
- **Confidence**: [Initial probability assessment]
- **Supporting Evidence**: [Examples that confirm this hypothesis]

**Hypothesis 2**: [Geometric/spatial relationship approach]
- **Core Principle**: [Symmetry, topology, or spatial reasoning foundation]
- **Transformation Rule**: [Alternative algorithmic description]
- **Confidence**: [Initial probability assessment]
- **Supporting Evidence**: [Examples that confirm this hypothesis]

**Hypothesis 3**: [Pattern completion/logical operation approach]
- **Core Principle**: [Information theory or logical reasoning foundation]
- **Transformation Rule**: [Third algorithmic description]
- **Confidence**: [Initial probability assessment]
- **Supporting Evidence**: [Examples that confirm this hypothesis]

### Phase 4: Reflexive Hypothesis Testing

For each hypothesis, systematically test against ALL examples:

**Testing Results**:
- **Hypothesis 1 Performance**: [Success rate, failure points, refinement needed]
- **Hypothesis 2 Performance**: [Success rate, failure points, refinement needed]
- **Hypothesis 3 Performance**: [Success rate, failure points, refinement needed]

**Failure Analysis**: [What do the failures reveal about the pattern?]
**Refinement Insights**: [How can hypotheses be improved or combined?]

### Phase 5: Iterative Refinement and Meta-Reasoning

**Reflection on Failed Hypotheses**:
- **What assumptions were incorrect?**
- **Which features were overlooked?**
- **How do failures guide better pattern recognition?**

**Hypothesis Evolution**:
- **Refined Hypothesis**: [Best hypothesis after reflection and testing]
- **Combination Strategy**: [If multiple hypotheses need integration]
- **Confidence Recalibration**: [Updated probability based on systematic testing]

**Meta-Cognitive Assessment**:
- **Pattern Recognition Strategy**: [Which representation helped most?]
- **Complexity Level**: [1-9 scale from basic transforms to meta-rule integration]
- **Generalization Potential**: [How well should this transfer to novel cases?]

### Phase 6: Final Verification and Implementation

**Systematic Debugging Protocol**:
1. **Consistency Check**: Does refined hypothesis work on ALL training examples?
2. **Edge Case Analysis**: How does it handle boundary conditions?
3. **Compression Assessment**: Is this the simplest rule that fits all data?
4. **Generalization Test**: Would this work on unseen examples with similar structure?

**Quality Metrics Assessment**:
- **Completeness**: [Percentage of training examples correctly explained]
- **Consistency**: [Degree of rule violations across examples]
- **Simplicity**: [Complexity penalty score]
- **Generalizability**: [Estimated robustness to novel inputs]

## Advanced Reflexive Techniques

Your iterative analysis should demonstrate:

- **Dynamic Knowledge Recombination**: Combine existing patterns in novel ways during testing
- **Compression-Based Pattern Discovery**: Use information theory to guide hypothesis selection
- **Multi-Stage Verification**: Test hypotheses at pixel, object, rule, and meta-rule levels
